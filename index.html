  	<h1>About My Data Story</h1>
			<p>My data story project was originally based off of observing my own viewing
			 preferences on Netflix and Hulu. I kept track of things such as genre, time, 
			 show, and paraActivity while watching in order to make connections between 
			 variables and see if there were any significant relationships. After analyzing
			  my data, I wanted to further delve into privacy protection rights and how 
			  companies can access and use your data and information. </p>

  	<h1>Data Visualization</h1>

My data visualization serves as a visual aide that represents the relationships and 
connections in my data. I noticed things like that the only time I do not do another
 activity while watching a show, is when I have never seen it before, and that I prefer
  a show like The Office when I am going to bed. Ultimately, this data visualization
   emphasizes how much information companies like Netflix or Hulu could gain about me by
    monitoring my viewing preferences.  This leads into the bigger picture of what rights
     to privacy the public actually has regarding what we watch.

  	<h1>Explanation Video</h1>
			<p>In this explanatory video, the concept of viewing privacy rights is 
			explored. Privacy rights are continuously being debated and amended and 
			often times, the public is unaware of what information of theirs is being
			 shared and used. I believe that this unawareness calls for a discussion
			  about what legislation protects the public and how that legislation is
			   constantly being updated and changed. Video privacy protection laws are
			    particularly interesting to look at when observing the evolution of 
			    technology and its role in society as the legislation was originally
			     directed towards video rental facilities and has been altered to adjust
			      for technological advances.</p>

  	<h1>The Big Take Away</h1>
			<p>While I learned a great deal of information regarding my own viewing 
			patterns and habits, I also learned about how companies use that data and what
			 hoops they have had to jump through to do so.  While exploring concepts such
			  as the Video Privacy Protection Act, it becomes apparent that society is
			   constantly changing and adopting new practices and values, and with these
			    new aspects, new adjustments have to be made to accommodate. Overall, 
			    this data story project illustrated how big of a role technology plays 
			    in everyday life.</p>
